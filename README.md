# Beacons Positioning

This repo contains some pieces that try to solve the problem of indoor positioning: locating a device inside a room using 3 or more beacons.

## Server

```
$ cd Server/
$ npm install
```

and then you have 2 options:

### Receive signals from bluetooth LE beacons and broadcast them through a socket.io API

```
$ node beacons-streamer.js
Usage: beacons-streamer [options]

Options:

-n, --number of <devices>  number of devices to listen to
-l, --logfile <filename>   the log file to save received signals
-p, --port <port>          listening port
```

### Broadcast signals of a logged session

```
$ node log-streamer.js 
Usage: log-streamer [options]

Options:

-l, --logfile <path>   path to the log file to stream
-n, --buffer <buffer>  number of devices to read until a value is streamed
-p, --port <port>      listening port
```

you can find some logs on `Server/saved-logs`.

### Details

The server behaves as a device (by capturing beacons signals, using the `noble` node module) and as an API that streams these values. In a future the server should only receive measured signals from the room beacons and expose an API allowing devices to see other devices around.

By collecting bluetooth signals, it can use the strength of each signal (RSSI) to calculate an estimated distance from the server to the beacon. Since Bluetooth signals attenuate due to environment elements (walls, people, other signals, etc.), it's pretty common to have a good amount of noise when measuring. Due to this fact, the server has a noise cancelling algorithm that basically average the last N measures and discard the top/bottom 10% in case there is some unexpected jump on the signal.

### Socket.IO API

```
socket.emit('update', [
{ name: 'iPad',
    distance: 2.0836143860600043,
    rssi: -59,
    timestamp: '3082' },
  { name: 'iPhone',
    distance: 3.4219873656782474,
    rssi: -58,
    timestamp: '3081' },
  { name: 'iPod touch',
    distance: 0.5376388832674435,
    rssi: -46,
    timestamp: '3081' }
]);
```

## Client

![](room.png)

You can have a simulated beacons environment by using a computer (with bluetooth LE) that runs the server and 3 iOS devices emitting in the room (see Estimote Virtual Beacon app). Then on another device (or using the iOS simulator), you can connect to the server using this client to see a map of the room and the devices positions.

The iOS client is an app that initially puts 3 beacons on the screen and can perform these actions:

### Play with a simulated room:

* touching and dragging near the beacon will move its position.
* touching (> 30 pixels away) from a beacon and dragging up/down will make the measured distance (gray circle) to vary according.
* you can tap on the 'Start Simulation' button to see small random variations on measured distance and see how the estimated position looks like.

### Read and visualize (heat map) the values from the server:

* The client will try to connect to the server on start to display the located devices on the map if successful. The bigger the heat map area, the more discrepancy there is between the measured distances, meaning the error is bigger.

### Details

In order to draw the heat map, there are two steps:

1. Determine the estimated position (x, y): This will be the center of the heat map and we're using a non-linear optimization method called [Levenberg Marquadt](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/unsupported/classEigen_1_1LevenbergMarquardt.html).

2. The above step will return an estimated position. By measuring the difference between this value and the distance that each beacon indicates, we can measure an estimated error. The bigger the error the bigger the heat map area.
